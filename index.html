        Mortal Kombat is a media franchise centered on a series of fighting
        video games originally developed by Midway Games in 1992. Mortal Kombat,
        the original game, spawned a franchise with several action-adventure
        game, a comic book series, a card game, films, an animated TV series,
        and a live-action tour. Mortal Kombat has become the best-selling
        fighting game franchise worldwide and one of the highest-grossing media
        franchises of all time. The series has a reputation for high levels of
        graphic violence, including, most notably, its fatalities, which are
        finishing moves that kill the defeated opponents instead of knocking
        them out. Controversies surrounding Mortal Kombat, in part, led to the
        creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) video game
        rating system. Early games in the series were noted for their realistic
        digitized sprites and an extensive use of palette swapping to create new
        characters. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the Mortal Kombat development
        team was acquired by Warner Bros. Entertainment and reestablished as
        NetherRealm Studios. It's In Our Blood! Discover a reborn Mortal Kombat
        Universe created by the Fire God Liu Kang. Mortal Kombat 1 ushers in a
        new era of the iconic franchise with a new fighting system, game modes,
        and fatalities! Mortal Kombat 1 is an upcoming fighting game developed
        by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Games. It will be
        the twelfth main installment in the Mortal Kombat series and a sequel to
        Mortal Kombat 11 (2019). Mortal Kombat 1 will be the series' second soft
        reboot, following Mortal Kombat (2011).[2] The game is set to be
        released for Windows, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo
        Switch on September 19, 2023.
